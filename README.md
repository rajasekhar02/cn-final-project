TWSN = Terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks

SC  = Small Cubes

WSN = Wireless Sensor Network Nodes

BS = Base Station node

BC = Big Cube

k = SC's edge length relates to the communication range of node c

G(m,n,h) = SC identifier

i(x,y,z) = node i coordinates

m = 

n = 

h =

a(f)^d

a(f) = absorption Coefficient

f = frequency of acoustic signal

d = distance between transmitter and receiver 

---

D(i,bs) = Distance between node and base station by its own coordinates
