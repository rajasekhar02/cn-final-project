What is UASN?
Underwater acoustic sensor networks

Where UASN are used ?
monitoring abnormal submarine oil pipelines, marine biology surveillance to earthquake and tsunami alert applications

Tasks in the Algorithm Simulation:
1. Generate x nodes with random location and BS is at (0,0,0)

2. Using the above coordinates of the sensors need to divide them into SC by considering the a value for k (10, 20, 30, 40)

3. Cluster Head Selection Algorithm

4. Tmax value has to be assumed be some constant value.

Simulation App 1:
================

To run the simulation for 100 rounds with 

number of nodes : 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600
Communication Range : 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
Average Residual Energy Output for the above after 100 simulations

PPT Algorithm Failure Points:
==============================
As we are using the random positioning what happens if there is no node in the first cube.

I have implemented the algorithm for static placed nodes

What is the communication channel between the nodes

What is the type of mac protocol used
