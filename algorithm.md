What is UASN?
Underwater acoustic sensor networks

Where UASN are used ?
monitoring abnormal submarine oil pipelines, marine biology surveillance to earthquake and tsunami alert applications

Tasks in the Algorithm Simulation:
1. Generate x nodes with random location and BS is at (0,0,0)

2. Using the above coordinates of the sensors need to divide them into SC by considering the a value for k (10, 20, 30, 40)

3. Cluster Head Selection Algorithm

4. Tmax value has to be assumed be some constant value.
